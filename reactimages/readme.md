# React Cog
A reaction images cog for Redbot that allows users to send various reaction images and GIFs in response to commands from a dedicated file to customize yourself. 

If you want a simpler cog, please use [kawaii.red](https://kawaii.red/) with sraven's [perform cog](https://github.com/sravan1946/sravan-cogs/tree/master)

I based the commands off of them because while I like their api, I want my own easy customizability for my friend's servers.

## Installation

1. **Download the repo with [Redbot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)**

```[p]repo add DreamyCogs https://github.com/DreamyKiley/DreamyCogs```

3. **Install the cog**
   
```[p]cog install DreamyCogs reactimages```

7. **Download the imagelist.txt**

Modify the imagelist.txt to your liking for each category you can use .png, .jpg, and .gif

7. **Load the imagelist.txt** <sub>so in my case I'd do</sub>
